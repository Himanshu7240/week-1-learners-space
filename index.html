        <h1 class="h-primary">All about Cricket History</h1>
        <p>
            Cricket, a sport with roots tracing back to 16th century England, evolved from a rural pastime to an
            international phenomenon. The first recorded match was played in 1646, and by the 18th century, it had
            gained popularity across England. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787, established the first
            formal rules. Cricket's global expansion began with British colonization, leading to the formation of the
            first international match in 1844 between the USA and Canada. The sport's pinnacle, Test cricket, started in
            1877 between England and Australia. Today, cricket is celebrated worldwide, particularly in countries like
            India, Australia, England, and the West Indies, with formats ranging from Tests to One-Day Internationals
            (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches.

        <h1 class="head">Basic rules </h1>
        <p>Cricket is played by two teams of 11, with one side taking a turn to bat a ball and score runs, while the
            other team will bowl and field the ball to restrict the opposition from scoring. The main objective in
            cricket is to score as many runs as possible against the opponent
